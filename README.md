# Flappy Bird HTML5 Clone

A basic HTML5 canvas game based on Flappy Bird, used as a fun experiment
to learn about a basic Webpack setup, HTML5 canvas and browser rendering
performance.

## How to play

After setting up the project and opening `dist/index.html` file with
your browser, you'll only need to press the `space bar` at your keyboard
in order to make the player "jump".

The game is simple, jump, try to fit the player between the spaces
available at the columns that are constantly showing up and try to reach
the highest score possible.

Instructions are included at the game in case they're needed.

## Setup
